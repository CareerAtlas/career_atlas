Created by: [Christine Ash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christine-ash-5a21743b/) (Frontend - Angular), [Robby Dore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robby-dore-61b88910b/) (Backend - Ruby On Rails), and [Jennifer Oakes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifernicoleoakes/) (Frontend - Angular).

## Project Details:

Finding a job specifically by location does not exist currently. CareerAtlas helps people know where specific jobs are available and helps people make better informed decisions when they are looking for a new opportunity. CareerAtlas allows users to see jobs that are currently listed on Indeed, populated on a map. The interface includes the ability to search for jobs by job title, job type, and location. CareerAtlas provides a superior user experience so job seekers can find a job that matches their lifestyle.
