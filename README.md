## What is CareerAtlas? ##

CareerAtlas, a location-based resource for jobs, uses WalkScore, GlassDoor, Indeed, and Google Maps APIs to provide job seekers a unique user experience and data set. The interface includes the ability to search for jobs via custom parameters, see job results populated on a map, and save jobs for future reference.

## How CareerAtlas works ##

*Describe how the app works and what things you can do here.*

The live site for CareerAtlas can be found at [CareerAtlas](https://careeratlas.herokuapp.com/). This application was built as a capstone project for an engineering immersive bootcamp at [The Iron Yard](https://www.theironyard.com/) in Washington, DC.
